Developed at ITP Summer Camp 2018

## Requirements

The installer script will auto-install brew, nvm, and node if you don't
have them yet since they're necessary to get your portfolio running.

## Usage

1. open a new terminal window, move to a directory you want this stuff
   to exist in, then copy/paste `curl https://kamalasaurus.github.io/processing-sketches/installer.sh | sh`
2. `cd processing-sketches`
2. `npm start`
